To calculate the value of x using NumPy, you can use the following approach:

1. Import NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np
```

2. Set up the equation:

```python
x = 0.123456789**987654321.0
```

3. Use NumPy's `exp` and `log` functions to calculate this more accurately:

```python
ln_x = 987654321.0 * np.log(0.123456789)
x = np.exp(ln_x)
```

4. Print the result:

```python
print(f"x = {x}")
```

The full code would look like this:

```python
import numpy as np

ln_x = 987654321.0 * np.log(0.123456789)
x = np.exp(ln_x)

print(f"x = {x}")
```

This will output a value extremely close to zero. In fact, it's so small that it will likely be represented as 0.0 due to floating-point limitations.

To get a sense of how small this number is, you can use scientific notation:

```python
print(f"x in scientific notation: {x:e}")
```

This will give you an idea of the order of magnitude of the result.

Keep in mind that this number is so incredibly small that it's effectively zero for most practical purposes. It's smaller than the smallest number that can be represented in standard double-precision floating-point format.
